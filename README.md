# susscore 🔍

**Instant scam detection for suspicious URLs.**

Paste a link. Get a sus score. It's that simple.

⚠️ **Important:** This tool provides automated analysis only. Always use common sense and verify suspicious links independently. No tool can guarantee 100% accuracy.

## What It Checks

- 🕐 **Domain Age** — New domains are sus (enhanced thresholds)
- 🔒 **SSL Certificate** — Missing or invalid = red flag
- 🚨 **Reputation** — Checks URLhaus malware & PhishTank phishing databases
- 🔗 **URL Patterns** — Detects phishing tricks, suspicious TLDs, & malicious patterns
- ↪️ **Redirect Chains** — Too many redirects = sketchy (with loop detection)
- 🌐 **DNS Records** — Validates domain resolution & checks for suspicious IPs
- 🎭 **Homograph Attacks** — Detects Unicode spoofing & look-alike characters
- 🎯 **Typosquatting** — Identifies domains impersonating popular brands
- 🔗 **URL Shorteners** — Flags shortened URLs with unknown destinations
